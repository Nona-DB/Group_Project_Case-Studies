The contents of this project are the following: 

 
  1: A README file (README_measures.pdf) which specifies the items of each scale/measure used in the original study of An et al.(2016) 


  2: Two CSV files, one of which is filtered (sun_study_gefilterd.csv) and one of contains the complete raw dataset (sun_study.csv). Note, the filtered file was used to conduct the reanalysis

  3: There are two R-scripts as well. One was used to transform the data (sav data omzetten.R) otherwhise it would not load into R. The other file is the file which contains
  all the steps that were conducted for the reanalysis (Rscript_sunny.R)

  Hope everything else is clear :) 

  Kind regards,
